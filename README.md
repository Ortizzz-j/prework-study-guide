# Prework Study Guide

##
The motivation behind the Prework Study Guide is to help propel forward my career in the direction of web developement. It is a project to look back on and reference when i might be stuck in the mud. A central place where i can look at notes i have taken as the bootcamp progresses. I learned a little about HTML and it mark up language, CSS and how to link it into my HTML so that the styles in CSS reflect, Javascript and how to link it as well in the body of the HTML at the very bottom of the code. Also with Javascript some call back functions and loops. 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
